Through the painting and the wite busts
In the corridor of the fountain
From a century I try to find you, I try

The veil, the veil of the night descends
Heavy upon our school

Where the music found shelter
From the havoc of the plebeians thirst

And I wonder why
Birds are silent now
And our tools of notes worn as your love

A young boy takes a violin
And puts all his dreams in it
And turns towards the dusky skyline, smiling

Smiling, as yet he ignores the minstrels fate
To need for a love vast as sky
Impossible to find

Or maybe he'll find flower
On which you'll share some joy
The kind of those
Greeting the end
