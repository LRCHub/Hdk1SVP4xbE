Can I stare without blinking
At you seeing me
Can I come without protecting
Or running away from
You, me, nothing in between

All alone we come and go
I long to be known
All alone we come and go
I long to be known by you
A resonance coming through

Can I dance without pulling back
I can't control you
I don't even want to
I can't control you
I don't even want to

All alone we come and go
I long to be known
All alone we come and go
I long to be known by you
A resonance between me and you

A resonance, resonance coming through
Resonance coming, coming through
